## About

Webstrap is a tool that allows you to get all the components you need for your next project in just one place.
* Select between H5BP, Bootstrap, jQuery, Backbone, RequireJS include whatever you want minified or with comments
* Choose your own file structure; before downloading you can change how the file structure looks like
* Minify CSS and JS afterwards right in the browser just 1 click

You select what you need and everything is fetched, archived and given to you in a nice .zip (known bug you can only extract in the CLI) so you can get started on your project right away
It is inspired by yeoman.io and twitter bootstrap
