<p>HTML5 Boilerplate is the professional frontend developers's base HTML/CSS/JS template for a fast, robust and future-safe site.</p>

A starter Apache .htaccess config file hooks you up with caching rules and preps your site to serve HTML5 video, use @font-face, and drop your site's filesize by half with robust gzipping.</p>
